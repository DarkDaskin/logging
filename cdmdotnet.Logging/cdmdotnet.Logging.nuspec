			cdmdotnet.Logging is an abstracted logging platform for .NET. It can help you collect reliable logs for your application regardless of its size or complexity with minimal performance implications.

			This package installs cdmdotnet.Logging.dll with includes core logging functionality. Other packages depend on cdmdotnet.Logging for specific implementations.

			The SqlLogger maps AdditionalData to table columns, where the key of the dictionary entry is the column name and the value is serialised to JSON as the column value.
			MetaData is serialised to a single JSON value stored in the MetaData column.
			TraceLogger and ConsoleLogger both seralise and format all information into a single string.
			The MultiLogger allows you to configure several different loggers to be used at once with different settings for each logger.
